====================================
Talking live to SpikeGLX from MATLAB
====================================


SpikeGLX Setup
==============

1. Launch SpikeGLX on the data acquisition machine. This machine and the MATLAB client machine must be connected to the same network.

2. Open SpikeGLX dialog 'Options/Command Server Settings...'.

3. Click 'Enable Remote Command Server' and then click 'My Address'.

4. Write down the IP address; you'll need to type that into the MATLAB client code.

Note: You can run SpikeGLX and MATLAB on the same machine, and in this configuration you can either use the computer's actual network address (per step 3), or the 'loopback' address if you don't have a network connection on this computer. Every computer has an internal 'loopback' address set to '127.0.0.1'. Use that with default port number 4142.

Note: If MATLAB times out (about 10 seconds) when trying to connect to SPikeGLX, it may be Windows Firewall blocking access. You can add SpikeGLX to the allowed list of applications by going to the top level of the Windows Control Panel and choosing 'System and Security/Windows Firewall/Allow a program through Windows Firewall.' In the Allowed Programs dialog you can then edit the settings for SpikeGLX or add it to the list if necessary.


MATLAB Setup
============

Needed components are located within Release subfolder 'SpikeGLX-MATLAB-SDK'.

1. Create a folder for your MATLAB client project, such as 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

2. Copy '@SPikeGL' into 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

3. From 'CalinsNetMex' folder, copy either 'CalinsNetMex.mexw32' or 'CalinsNetMex.mexw64' into 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'. The choice depends upon whether you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit installation of MATLAB. (It doesn't hurt anything to copy both to your project folder; MATLAB should automatically use the correct one).

4. To get started with example code, copy 'demoRemoteAPI.m' into 'My_SGLX_MATLAB'.

In summary, your folder looks like:

  My_SGLX_MATLAB
      @SpikeGL
      CalinsNetMex.mexw64
      demoRemoteAPI.m


Running MATLAB
==============

1. Launch MATLAB, add 'My_SGLX_MATLAB' to your path.

2. Navigate to 'My_SGLX_MATLAB' and open 'demoRemoteAPI.m'.

3. Edit the line 'hSGL = SpikeGL('10.101.20.29');' to reflect the correct IP address.

4. Go to the section called 'Variety of set/get calls to try' and choose a trial test function by uncommenting it. For example, try 'file = GetDataDir(hSGL)' which will return the data directory whether SpikeGLX is running an acquisition or is currently idle.

5. Experiment with other commands (only a few are demonstrated in this m file).
