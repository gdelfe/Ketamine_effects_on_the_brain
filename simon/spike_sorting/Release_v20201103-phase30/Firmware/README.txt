The Imec module (base station card) firmware files in this folder must be loaded into a module before it can be used.

Use the SpikeGLX menu item 'Tools/Update Imec Firmware' to load these files.

Read the help document in that dialog ('?' in titlebar).

After loading the files [[ BOTH THE CHASSIS AND COMPUTER MUST BE POWER CYCLED, THAT IS, SHUT BOTH OFF, WAIT A FEW SECONDS, THEN TURN ON AGAIN ]].

Once firmware is loaded, its version numbers are read back by pressing the 'Detect' button in the 'Configure Acquisition' dialog.

The files in this folder will detect with versions:


- BS(slot N) firmware version 2.0.137
