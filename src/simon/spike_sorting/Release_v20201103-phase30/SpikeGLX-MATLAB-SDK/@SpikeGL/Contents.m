% SYNOPSIS
% --------
%
% The @SpikeGL class is a MATLAB object with methods to access the
% SpikeGLX program via TCP/IP. SpikeGLX and MATLAB can run on the
% same machine (via loopback socket address 127.0.0.1 and port 4142)
% or across a network.
%
% This class provides extensive control over a running SpikeGLX process:
% starting and stopping a run, setting parameters, calling the Par2 and
% SHA1 tools, and so on.
%
% Users of this class merely need to construct an instance of a @SpikeGL
% object and all network communication with the SpikeGLX process is handled
% automatically.
%
% The network socket handle is used with the 'CalinsNetMex' mexFunction,
% which is a helper mexFunction that does all the actual socket
% communications for this class (since MATLAB lacks native network
% support).
%
% Instances of @SpikeGL are weakly stateful: merely keeping a handle to a
% network socket. It is ok to create and destroy several of these objects.
% Each network connection cleans up after itself after 10 seconds of
% inactivity. By the way, if your script has pauses longer than 10 seconds,
% and you reuse a handle that has timed out, the handle will automatically
% reestablish a connection and the script will likely continue without
% problems, but a warning will appear in the Command Window refelecting
% the timeout. Such warnings have a warningid, so you can suppress them
% by typing >> warning( 'off', 'CalinsNetMex:connectionClosed' ).
%
%
% EXAMPLES
% --------
%
% my_s = SpikeGL;   % connect to SpikeGLX running on local machine
%
% prms = GetParams( my_s ); % retrieve run params
%
% SetParams( my_s, struct('niMNChans1','0:5','niDualDevMode','false',...) );
%
% StartRun( my_s ); % starts data acquisition run using last-set params
%
% StopRun( my_s );  % stop run and clean up
%
% StreamID
% --------
%
% Several functions work for either the NI data stream or for any of the
% N enabled IMEC probe streams. StreamID = -1 selects NI. Values in the
% range [0,..,N-1] select an IMEC stream.

%                'filename'. Arguments:
%
%                op: a string that is either 'c', 'v', or 'r' for create,
%                verify or repair respectively.
%
%                filename: the .par2 or .bin file to which 'op' is applied.
%
%                Progress is reported to the command window.
%
%    myobj = SetAudioEnable( myobj, bool_flag )
%
%                Set audio output on/off. Note that this command has
%                no effect if not currently running.
%
%    myobj = SetAudioParams( myobj, group_string, params_struct )
%
%                Set subgroup of parameters for audio-out operation. Parameters
%                are a struct of name/value pairs. This call stops current output.
%                Call SetAudioEnable( myobj, 1 ) to restart it.
%
%    myobj = SetDataDir( myobj, i, dir )
%
%                Set ith global data directory.
%                Set required parameter i to zero for main data directory.
%
%    myobj = SetDigOut( myobj, bool_flag, channels )
%
%                Set digital output on/off. Channel strings have form:
%                'Dev6/port0/line2,Dev6/port0/line5'.
%
%    myobj = SetMetaData( myobj, metadata_struct )
%
%                If a run is in progress, set meta data to be added to the
%                next output file set. Meta data must be in the form of a
%                struct of name/value pairs.
%
%    myobj = SetMultiDriveEnable( myobj, bool_flag )
%
%                Set multi-drive run-splitting on/off.
%
%    myobj = SetNextFileName( myobj, 'name' )
%
%                If a run is in progress, set the full path and run name
%                for the next file set. For example, "Y:/mydir/../myrun."
%                To that, SpikeGLX appends the stream and extension, for
%                example, "Y:/mydir/../myrun.imec0.ap.bin." SpikeGLX will
%                not create any folders or add any _g_t tags, so the name
%                is under full user control. SpikeGLX clears your custom
%                name and reverts to auto-naming after the current files
%                are written. You must, therefore, call this function for
%                each file set, and you must set the name before a trigger
%                event for that file set.
%
%    myobj = SetParams( myobj, params_struct )
%
%                The inverse of GetParams.m, this sets run parameters.
%                Alternatively, you can pass the parameters to StartRun()
%                which calls this in turn. Run parameters are a struct of
%                name/value pairs. The call will fail with an error if a
%                run is currently in progress.
%
%    myobj = SetRecordingEnable( myobj, bool_flag )
%
%                Set triggering (file writing) on/off for current run.
%                This command has no effect if not running.
%
%    myobj = SetRunName( myobj, 'name' )
%
%                Set the run name for the next time files are created
%                (either by SetTrgEnable() or by StartRun()).
%
%    myobj = SetTriggerOffBeep( myobj, hertz, millisec )
%
%                Set frequency and duration of Windows beep signalling
%                file closure. hertz=0 disables the beep. Command has
%                no effect if not currently running.
%
%    myobj = SetTriggerOnBeep( myobj, hertz, millisec )
%
%                Set frequency and duration of Windows beep signalling
%                file creation. hertz=0 disables the beep. Command has
%                no effect if not currently running.
%
%    myobj = StartRun( myobj )
%    myobj = StartRun( myobj, params )
%    myobj = StartRun( myobj, runName )
%
%                Start data acquisition run. Optional second argument (params)
%                is a struct of name/value pairs as returned from GetParams.m.
%                Alternatively, the second argument can be a string (runName).
%                Last-used parameters remain in effect if not specified here.
%                An error is flagged if already running or a parameter is bad.
%
%    myobj = StopRun( myobj )
%
%                Unconditionally stop current run, close data files
%                and return to idle state.
%
%    res = VerifySha1( myobj, filename )
%
%                Verifies the SHA1 sum of the file specified by filename.
%                If filename is relative, it is appended to the run dir.
%                Absolute path/filenames are also supported. Since this is
%                a potentially long operation, it uses the 'disp' command
%                to print progress information to the MATLAB console. The
%                returned value is 1 if verified, 0 otherwise.
